   ```

## Execution Steps

### Task 1: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_task1_data_cleaning_eda.ipynb
```
**What it does:**
- Loads and cleans raw fraud data
- Performs comprehensive EDA with fraud pattern insights
- Engineers features (time-based, transaction patterns, geolocation)
- Handles class imbalance using SMOTE
- Saves processed data for modeling

### Task 2: Model Building and Evaluation
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/02_task2_modeling.ipynb
```
**What it does:**
- Trains multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluates performance using imbalanced data metrics (F1-Score, AUC-PR)
- Performs hyperparameter tuning
- Compares models and selects the best performer
- Saves models and evaluation results

### Task 3: Model Explainability and Business Insights
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/03_task3_model_explainability.ipynb
```
**What it does:**
- Performs SHAP analysis on the best model
- Generates feature importance plots
- Provides business insights and fraud detection recommendations
- Creates explainable AI visualizations

## Key Results

### Model Performance Comparison
| Model | F1-Score | AUC-PR | Precision | Recall | Training Time |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.85 | 0.78 | 0.82 | 0.88 | 2.3s |
| Random Forest | 0.92 | 0.89 | 0.90 | 0.94 | 15.7s |
| XGBoost | 0.91 | 0.88 | 0.89 | 0.93 | 12.1s |

### Top Fraud Indicators (SHAP Analysis)
1. **Transaction Velocity** - High frequency transactions (SHAP importance: 0.23)
2. **Time Since Signup** - Quick transactions after account creation (0.19)
3. **Geographic Anomalies** - Unusual transaction locations (0.15)
4. **Device Patterns** - Multiple accounts from same device (0.12)
5. **Purchase Amount** - Unusual transaction values (0.11)

### Feature Engineering Insights

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Import Errors**
   ```
   Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'shap'
   Solution: pip install shap
   ```

2. **Memory Issues**
   ```
   Error: MemoryError during SHAP analysis
   Solution: Reduce sample size in Task 3 (fraction_test = 0.001)
   ```

3. **Model Loading Errors**
   ```
   Error: FileNotFoundError: '../results/best_model.pkl'
   Solution: Run Task 2 first to generate models
   ```

4. **Data Loading Issues**
   ```
   Error: FileNotFoundError: '../data/raw/Fraud_Data.csv'
   Solution: Ensure raw data files are in data/raw/ directory
   ```

### Performance Optimization
- **GPU Acceleration**: Use CUDA-enabled XGBoost for faster training
- **Parallel Processing**: Enable n_jobs=-1 for Random Forest
- **Memory Management**: Use data sampling for large datasets
- **Caching**: Save intermediate results to avoid recomputation
