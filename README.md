### Task 3: Model Explainability
- **SHAP Analysis:**
  - Global and local feature importance
  - Summary and force plots
  - Business interpretation of key drivers

## Feature Engineering Rationale
Each feature was engineered based on domain knowledge, EDA findings, and the goal of improving the model's ability to detect subtle fraud patterns:

- **hour_of_day:** Captures the hour of transaction; fraud may occur at unusual times (e.g., late at night).
- **day_of_week:** Certain days may see more fraud due to business cycles or attacker behavior.
- **time_since_signup:** Measures how quickly a user transacts after signup; fraudsters often act quickly to avoid detection.
- **transaction_count:** Total transactions per user; helps distinguish between normal and abnormal user behavior.
- **transactions_last_24h:** Captures transaction velocity; sudden spikes can indicate fraud.

Each feature is not only technically relevant but also directly tied to business hypotheses about how fraudsters behave differently from legitimate users.

## Model Selection Strategy
For the modeling phase, both interpretability and predictive power are prioritized:

- **Logistic Regression:** Used as a baseline for its interpretability and ability to provide clear insights into feature importance. It is well-suited for imbalanced classification when combined with class weighting or resampling.
- **Ensemble Model (Random Forest or Gradient Boosting):** Chosen for their ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships and handle feature interactions, which are common in fraud detection. These models are robust to outliers and can provide feature importance rankings.

Model evaluation focuses on metrics appropriate for imbalanced data, such as F1-score and AUC-PR. The choice of models aligns with the business need for both explainability (to build trust with stakeholders) and high predictive performance (to minimize financial losses).

## Handling Class Imbalance
Class imbalance is a significant challenge in fraud detection. To address this, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is applied to the training data:

- **Before SMOTE:** The dataset is highly imbalanced, with very few fraud cases compared to legitimate transactions.
- **After SMOTE:** The training set is balanced, allowing the model to better learn fraud patterns and generalize to new, unseen cases.

SMOTE was chosen because it creates synthetic samples of the minority class, leading to a more informative training set and improved model generalization. The effectiveness of SMOTE is evaluated using appropriate metrics for imbalanced data, such as F1-score and AUC-PR.

## EDA & Feature Engineering Insights
- **Fraud Patterns:**
  - The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions representing a small fraction of the total
  - Fraudulent transactions tend to have higher purchase values
  - Certain sources and browsers are associated with higher fraud rates
  - Temporal and geolocation patterns reveal additional risk factors
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Time-based features (hour_of_day, day_of_week, time_since_signup) capture behavioral signals
  - Transaction frequency and velocity features help identify suspicious activity
  - All features are chosen based on domain knowledge and observed data patterns

## Class Imbalance Strategy
- **Challenge:** Fraudulent transactions are rare, making standard modeling approaches ineffective
- **Solution:** SMOTE is applied to the training data to generate synthetic fraud cases, improving the model's ability to detect fraud
- **Justification:** This approach increases recall and precision for the minority class, which is critical for business impact

## Processed Data
- All cleaned and feature-engineered datasets are saved in `data/processed/`.
- These files are ready for use in model training and evaluation in subsequent tasks.

## Key Results & Model Comparison
| Model                | F1-Score | AUC-PR | Business Value                          |
|----------------------|----------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression  | 0.27     | 0.45   | Interpretable, good for compliance      |
| Random Forest        | 0.99     | 1.00   | High performance, best for deployment   |
| (Optional) XGBoost   | TBD      | TBD    | Advanced, may offer further gains       |

**Recommendation:** Random Forest is recommended for deployment due to its superior performance. Logistic Regression remains valuable for interpretability and regulatory needs.

## Model Explainability
- **SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations):**
  - Used to interpret the best-performing model (Random Forest)
  - Summary and force plots reveal the most important features driving fraud predictions
  - Key drivers: purchase_value, time_since_signup, transaction_count, certain browsers/sources
  - Business users can use these insights to refine fraud rules and monitoring

## Limitations & Next Steps
- **Limitations:**
  - Models may not generalize to new fraud patterns (concept drift)
  - Data quality and feature availability may vary in production
  - False positives can impact user experience
- **Next Steps:**
  - Further hyperparameter tuning and advanced model comparison (XGBoost/LightGBM)
  - Integrate explainability into business dashboards
  - Set up monitoring for model drift and retrain as needed
  - Explore real-time scoring and deployment
